# AI Pest Control guides

*How to turn off unwanted, enabled-by-default AI features on various services*

Provides information on where you can go to turn off unwanted features, settings, and UI elements,
and how to protect your information from being used for AI training.

## List of guides

* [Apple](apple.md): iOS, OS X
* [Amazon](amazon.md): AWS

## Future plans

For features that can't be turned off, you can at least remove the UI elements from the page.
Currently such solutions are only provided as JS snippets, but I would like to eventually make browser extensions (or adblocker plugins) to apply these automatically.

All guides are licensed under the Unlicense as described in the [LICENSE](LICENSE).

I don't have everything, so I've added issues for some of the main platforms that I don't use but need help with: https://github.com/jonathangjertsen/ai-pest-control/issues
