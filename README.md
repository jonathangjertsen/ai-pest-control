# AI Pest Control guides

*How to turn off unwanted, enabled-by-default AI features on various services*

Provides information on where you can go to turn off unwanted features, settings, and UI elements.

For features that can't be turned off, you can at least remove the UI elements from the page.
Currently such solutions are only provided as JS snippets, but there should be a browser extension (or adblocker plugin) to apply these automatically.
