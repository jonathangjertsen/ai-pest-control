# AI Pest Control guides

*How to turn off unwanted, enabled-by-default AI features on various services*

Provides information on where you can go to turn off unwanted features, settings, and UI elements,
and how to protect your information from being used for AI training.

## List of guides

* [Atlassian](atlassian.md): Bitbucket, Jira, Confluence
* [Google](google.md): Search, Drive, Workspaces
* [LinkedIn](linkedin.md): Website
* [Microsoft](microsoft.md): GitHub

## Future plans

For features that can't be turned off, you can at least remove the UI elements from the page.
Currently such solutions are only provided as JS snippets, but I would like to eventually make browser extensions (or adblocker plugins) to apply these automatically.

## Contributing
