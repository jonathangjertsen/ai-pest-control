## iOS

### Siri nag in settings

I think you have to set up Siri and then turn it off, in order to remove the nag message.

Siri can be disabled under **Settings** -> **Siri** -> **Talk to Siri (off)**.

### Face ID nag in settings

I think you have to set up Face ID and then turn it off, in order to remove the nag message.
